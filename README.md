As a result of COVID-19, many companies have been forced to function with working remotely employees and to adopt technologies that enable collaboration from a distance.

Companies have invested a lot in remote work tools already, and they have seen positive results, and most of the cases productivity has accelerated!

Post COVID-19, many companies have already announced that they won't be returning to the old way of working every day from the office anymore.

Working remotely more often not only will help reduce traffic jams and save time on commuting, but also can save the employers a lot of money on the office and real estate costs.

According to a research, an employer can save $11,000 a year for every employee who works remotely half the time!
